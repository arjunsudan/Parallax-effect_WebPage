          <br /><br />If you’re new to cycling—whether it is a goal to stay
          healthy, became a great source of relief during the COVID-19 era, or
          you picked it up because of soaring gas prices—congrats!

          <br />
          <br />There are so many amazing adventures in store for you. But we
          also understand that cycling can feel really overwhelming at first. On
          top of knowing the basic rules of the road, it can seem like there’s a
          whole set of unwritten rules out there as well. Can you wear low
          socks? Do your water bottles need to match? Well, we’re here to say:
          Forget the rules. Riding bikes should be fun, and in order for you to
          have the most fun out there, we rounded up the best beginner cycling
          tips to help you get rolling. These aren’t rules; they’re just
          suggestions and simple fixes that’ll make riding more safe and
          enjoyable.
